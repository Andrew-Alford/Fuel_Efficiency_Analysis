# Fuel Efficiency Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents an analysis of the mtcars dataset in R, focusing on the relationship between various car attributes and fuel efficiency (mpg).

## Contents
- Creation of a data frame from mtcars dataset.
- Bivariate correlation analysis to identify potential predictors of mpg.
- Multiple regression analysis using mpg as the dependent variable.
- Examination of weight (wt) and horsepower (hp) as significant predictors.
- Application of Bayesian methods to corroborate findings.

## Findings
- Strong negative correlations between mpg and factors like wt and hp.
- Weight and horsepower significantly impact fuel efficiency, with heavier and more powerful cars being less fuel-efficient.
- Bayesian analysis supports these conclusions, providing robust statistical evidence.

## Conclusions
The study concludes that car attributes, particularly weight and horsepower, have a substantial impact on fuel efficiency. These findings are crucial for automotive design and environmental considerations, highlighting the importance of optimizing these attributes for better fuel efficiency.
